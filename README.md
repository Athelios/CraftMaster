## What is CraftMaster‚ùì

CraftMaster is a 3D sandbox game developed by three software engineering students at Mcmaster University. It is a reimplementation of [@fogleman/Minecraft](https://github.com/fogleman/Minecraft)(refered to as orginal project) which is developed by **_Michael Fogleman_**. CraftMaster is written in **Python** and **Pyglet**. All the media source are open-source and found online. The executable game is generated by **Pyintsaller**.
We believe that the software design principles and software architectural design patterns we applied to the project significantly increased the quality of the software. The highlights of CraftMaster are the module decomposition and novel functionalities/features of the game.
The team has also developed and deployed a game website to hold the game for downloading.
